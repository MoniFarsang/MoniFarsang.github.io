I am a PhD student in Computer Engineering at the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), co-supervised by Prof. Radu Grosu (TU Wien), Prof. Gerhard Sch√ºtz (TU Wien), and Prof. Daniela Rus (MIT). My research focuses on the interpretability of bio-inspired neural networks in robotics and autonomous systems. I work with architectures such as Neural Circuit Policies (NCPs) and Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs), inspired by *C. elegans*, to enhance transparency and trust in AI decision-making while ensuring efficiency for real-world applications.
